# Employee-Absenteeism-Analysis-Prediction-Using-SQL-Python-Tableau
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee absenteeism during working days using various analytical tools such as SQL, Python, and Tableau. The aim is to understand the underlying reasons behind absenteeism and identify patterns based on factors such as education level, family situation, commuting distance, and medical reasons.

The data used in this project is secondary data, sourced from an external dataset. This realistic business scenario helps in developing practical skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization to support data-driven decision-making in HR analytics.

üß† Business Problem:
To analyze the absenteeism behavior of employees and predict the likelihood of absenteeism based on various factors. The key goal is to help HR and management proactively address issues that lead to frequent absences, improving productivity and employee well-being.

üîß Tools Used:
SQL (MySQL): For data extraction and integration

Python (Jupyter Notebook): For data preprocessing, analysis, and predictive modeling

Tableau: For data visualization and interactive dashboards

üìä Business Task:
Predicting Absenteeism from Work

üîç Project Workflow & Key Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing & Exploration
Step 1:

Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., Employee ID)

Created dummy variables for categorical column ‚ÄúReason for Absence‚Äù

Step 2:

Grouped reasons for absence into medical categories

Checked for multicollinearity

Used .loc[] method for column-wise grouping

Step 3:

Concatenated updated columns

Renamed and re-ordered columns for clarity and ease of use

Created data checkpoint for backup

Step 4:

Converted date column using pd.to_datetime()

Extracted month from date column to analyze seasonal patterns

Step 5:

Converted the education column into dummy variables

Built a machine learning model to predict probability of absenteeism

2. Database Integration
Connected MySQL with Jupyter Notebook using PyMySQL

Queried and analyzed the data directly from the SQL database

3. Visualization
Created visualizations in Tableau to identify:

Top reasons for absence

Trends across months

Absenteeism patterns based on education, distance, and family factors

‚úÖ Outcome:
Built a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of absenteeism

Delivered actionable insights through visual dashboards for HR decision-making

Improved understanding of key factors influencing employee attendance
